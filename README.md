## Chess Game

This is simplified chess game that reads movements from a .txt and prints the board updates in the console.

In the case of a check mate subsequent moves are impossible, although it reads all the rest of the movements in the file.

Doesn't deal with pawn promotion, en passant or castling.

### Usage

 sbt "run <moves_file_path>"

 While being inside of the project's folder.
